## preinst script for qubes-whonix

# see: dh_installdeb(1)
#
# The preinst script may be called in the following ways:
#   * <new-preinst> 'install'
#   * <new-preinst> 'install' <old-version>
#   * <new-preinst> 'upgrade' <old-version>
#
#     The package will not yet be unpacked, so the preinst script cannot rely
# on any files included in its package. Only essential packages and
# pre-dependencies (Pre-Depends) may be assumed to be available.
# Pre-dependencies will have been configured at least once, but at the time the
# preinst is called they may only be in an "Unpacked" or "Half-Configured" state
# if a previous version of the pre-dependency was completely configured and has
# not been removed since then.
#
#
#  * <old-preinst> 'abort-upgrade' <new-version>
#
#    Called during error handling of an upgrade that failed after unpacking the
# new package because the postrm upgrade action failed. The unpacked files may
# be partly from the new version or partly missing, so the script cannot rely
# on files included in the package. Package dependencies may not be available.
# Pre-dependencies will be at least "Unpacked" following the same rules as
# above, except they may be only "Half-Installed" if an upgrade of the
# pre-dependency failed.[46]
#
#    For details, see http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ or
# https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-maintainerscripts.html or
# the debian-policy package
